test url:
./index.html?homework-1

./index.html?homework-2


URL search param parse to get the page to load

get assignment id from page to load

loop tests for each assignment

assignment includes title and test(s); a test is some script to eval, expected result, success msg and fail message

on success, post to a database


need to find a way to ignore stylesheets of the test page  (i > 0 ?)

can use corsanywhere to handle pages with script
